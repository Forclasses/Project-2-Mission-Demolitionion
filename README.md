# Project-2-Mission-Demolitionion


Hello for fun stuff that got added there is a chance that the player will ge a "Heavy ball" which is a ball that weighs 20 compard to the normal 5. Also I added alot more buildings, 7 in total, they are a bit of a pain to deal with on some of them. Everything else is basically stock because I didn't know how to make buttons only show up when on the end stage. Thats about it.

I didn't add rubber due to the fact that I was not confent in my abilty to add it without breakinging something. I tried to add it when I started but that kinda fell flat as I went throgh the book. Just about everthing else got done bar sounds and the like. I am mostly happy with what I got done.
