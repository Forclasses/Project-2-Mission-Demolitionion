# Project-2-Mission-Demolitionion


Hello for fun stuff that got added there is a chance that the playewr will ge a "Heavy ball" which is a ball that weighs 20 compard to the normal 5. Also I added alot more buildings, 7 in total, they are a bit of a pain to deal with on some of them. Everything else is basically stock because I didn't know how to make buttons only show up when on the end stage. THats about it.
